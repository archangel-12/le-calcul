it seems that individuals in stem majors tend to find it easy to create a basic calculator using javascript. however, as a student coming from a different field of study, this is a new experience for me. while i find it challenging and imperfect, that's just part of the learning process :)

uh basically i made this simple calculator using [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/), and for me, this marks my first exposure to the existence of libraries or packages that serve a similar purpose to [dart](https://dart.dev/) in [flutter](https://flutter.dev/learn).

like i said, i've made this simple app from someone by [drawing inspiration from those who have previously ventured into creating similar calculators](https://youtu.be/wgBC-CUQEGs), way before i even delve into javaScript or python or any other kind languages. so yeah, if you ask me "*this*" calculator is original by my own craft, the answer is __no__. matter of fact why i'm lying?

oh by the way, if you really want to download this repo (which i wonder why), you'd better install electron first and [necessary packages](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-are-node-modules/), otherwise it's not gonna work.

yeah i think that's about it
